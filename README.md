# EFC Domitian

EFC Domitian is a project to develop a full-featured, free and open-source implementation of Hermann Zapf's Palatino design. "Domitian" is in refrerence to builder of the Flavian Palace, located on the Palatine Hill.

## History

Palatino was designed by Hermann Zapf and published by D. Stempel AG in 1949 as a metal typeface. Due to its unexpected use as a book typeface, many glyphs were redesigned by Zapf in the decades before its digitization in the early 1980s. It was a standard font included in the PostScript system, and the PostScript glyph variants became standard in most following digitizations, including this one, which is based on URW's digitization "P052". P052 spawned many derivatives used in the TeX community, often with incompatible licenses. This implementation is based on D. Benjamin Miller's "Domitian", based on the second release of P052 by URW in the mid-2010s.
